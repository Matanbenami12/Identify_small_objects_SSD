In order to determine the distance from our camera to a known object , we are going to use Gaussian  lens formulaca with few edits for our project .
First we will look at the following figure to understand Gaussian  lens formula:

Given an MN central lens, an optical axis passing through the point, O and a point light source A.
The points F_1 and F_2 are the focal points of the lens. I move the three Kepler rays to see where our imaginary figure will be formed:
The first beam A, O, A 'emerges from the light source and passes through the center of the lens, so it continues straight.
The second beam A, P, A 'emerges from the light source parallel to the optical axis, refracts and passes through the distant focus. F_2
The third beam A, Q, A 'emerges from the light source, passes through the nearest focus F_1, and refracts and continues parallel to the optical axis. (Point A' is the imaginary figure)
From the points' A and A I lower the vertical to the optical axis so that the verticals' B 'A and AB are obtained
According to the lens settings we will mark:
 u = AP = BO  (horizontal distance of the light source from the lens)
Q = v 'A = O' B - (the horizontal distance of the figure from the lens)
  F_1 O = F_2 O = f - (focal length)
   - AB = PO = H_O (the vertical distance of the light source from the optical axis)
 = H_i 'B' A = QO - (The vertical distance of the figure from the optical axis)
  
From geometry of figure above, right angle ΔABO and ΔA’B’O are similar.  
  
  
  
  
  
  The figure above shows that formation of a real, inverted and diminished image A’B’ of the object AB placed beyond the centre of curvature at a distance u from the convex lens. Let v be the image distance. 

According to Cartesian sign convention,

Object distance (OB) = -u

Image distance (OB’) = +v

Focal length (OF1 = OF2) = +f

From geometry of figure above, right angle ΔABO and ΔA’B’O are similar.
 

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  In order to determine the distance from our camera to a known object or marker, we are going to utilize triangle similarity.

The triangle similarity goes something like this: Let’s say we have a marker or object with a known width W. We then place this marker some distance D from our camera. We take a picture of our object using our camera and then measure the apparent width in pixels P. This allows us to derive the perceived focal length F of our camera:
